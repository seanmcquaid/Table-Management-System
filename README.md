# Table Management System

I decided to make this as a way to potentially make my own table availability system for a restaurant during COVID! This was my first time working with Vue.js and GraphqQL on a Full-Stack personal project and definitely experienced some growing pains while working on this. I really enjoyed learning Vue.js and plan to continue building with it for some future personal projects!
